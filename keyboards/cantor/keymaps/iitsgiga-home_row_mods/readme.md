# Cantor Remix keymap created by iiTsGiga 

This is a custom keymap for the *Cantor Remix* keyboard from *[keebd.com](https://keebd.com/products/cantor-remix-keyboard-kit)* inspired by the *[Miryoku](https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku/)* keymap.

Changes include:

- Dvorak layout on base layer (including umlauts and eszett)
- relocation of keys on every layer
- removed button and additional features layers (added quantum keys to media layer)
- replaced modifiers on symbol layer with additional symbols and added second symbol layer for U.S. international layout specific characters
- removed modifiers from media and mouse layers
- expanded number layer with additional characters to allow for scientific and programming notations
