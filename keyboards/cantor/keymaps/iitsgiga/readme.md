# Cantor Remix keymap created by iiTsGiga 

This is a custom keymap for the *Cantor Remix* keyboard from *[keebd.com](https://keebd.com/products/cantor-remix-keyboard-kit)*.

It uses the Dvorak layout as a base, but replaces the symbols on the base layer with the umlauts and the eszett.

The second and third layers contain a number pad and the most important symbols, including those from the original base layer of the Dvorak layout.

To avoid accidental use of modifiers while speed typing (due to key *rolling*), the modifiers are placed on separate layers, which also contain the rest of the basic symbols. These layers also contain the Delete and Backspace keys for easy multi-character deletion with your middle fingers.

The sixth layer contains the basic navigation keys and additional momentary layer keys for the last three layers.

The seventh layer contains media control keys, the Insert key and additional symbols from the U.S. international layout.

The eighth layer contains all possible mouse controls.

The last layer contains the function keys.

The left/right division of the second/third and fourth/fifth layers is intended to allow the modifier keys to be used with any other possible key from the other side of the keyboard (except for the media and mouse controls and the non-ASCII symbols).

The thumb keys always behave the same, so the above functionality works as intended.
The thumb keys include the Alt + Backspace and Ctrl + Backspace shortcuts,since retyping the entire word is often faster than using individual backspaces.
